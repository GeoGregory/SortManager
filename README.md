# Sort Manager

#Table of contents

# Project Requirements:

You will be building a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:
1. The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from
2. Decision is given via the command line (Scanner)
3. The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line (Scanner)
4. The program should then output:
- The unsorted randomly generated array
- The sort algorithm to be used
- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
- The time taken

You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the performance of the algorithms (speed tests)

You should include but are not limited to:
- BubbleSort
- MergeSort (iterative or recursive)
- BinaryTreeSort

Additions:
- GUI
- Logging
- Using File IO to read the list of sorter classes instead of hard coding a list
- Generic Sorts (Consider interaction with a suitable interface)
- Good code structure in accordance with design patterns (refactoring)

Submission:
- Code should be hosted on your own Github page with a suitable README.md file
- A link to your completed project should be emailed to mgadhvi@spartaglobal.com and kcornwall@spartaglobal.com by 23:59 on 2021-12-17
